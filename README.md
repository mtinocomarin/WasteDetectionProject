This project aims to develop a machine learning
model that provides guidance on proper waste disposal by
performing object detection and classification on various waste
materials. Using YOLOv11n, the model was trained on a dataset
of 10,000 images spanning six categories. YOLOv11n, the model
was trained on a data set of 10,000 images in six categories.
Achieving a precision of 0.657 and a recall of 0.53, and demon-
strating exceptional performance for glass (mAP@50: 0.856) and
metal (mAP@50: 0.77), the model achieves a balance between
accuracy and efficiency. The model was successfully deployed
on a Raspberry Pi 4, confirming its usability for real-world
applications. This research demonstrates how machine learning
can improve waste management, thereby contributing to global
efforts to reduce pollution. Future developments will focus on
integrating mobile applications to enable more impactful and
accessible recycling solutions.
